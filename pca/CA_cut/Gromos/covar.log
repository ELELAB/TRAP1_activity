Read 6001 frames from /data/user/shared_projects/trap1_activity/simulations/analysis_SH.SNO/pca/monomer/CA_cut/Gromos/traj_comb_mono.xtc (time 0 to 600000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from /data/user/shared_projects/trap1_activity/simulations/analysis_SH.SNO/pca/monomer/CA_cut/Gromos/traj.gro
Read index groups from index.pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'CA' (609 atoms)
Fit group is 'r_484-501_r_504-507_r_516-519_r_523-531_r_549-552_r_557-568_r_570-588' (70 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 1827x1827 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 17903.1
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 17903.2

Wrote 1827 eigenvalues to eigenval.xvg
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and eigenvec.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 1827 to eigenvec.trr
