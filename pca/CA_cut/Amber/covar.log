Read 6001 frames from /data/user/shared_projects/trap1_activity/simulations/analysis_SH.SNO/pca/monomer/CA_cut/Amber/traj_comb_mono.xtc (time 0 to 600000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from /data/user/shared_projects/trap1_activity/simulations/analysis_SH.SNO/pca/monomer/CA_cut/Amber/traj.gro
Read index groups from index.pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'CA' (609 atoms)
Fit group is 'r_484-501_r_504-507_r_516-519_r_523-531_r_549-552_r_557-568_r_570-588' (70 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
