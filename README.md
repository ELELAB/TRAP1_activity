This repository contains the input data for the modelling and simulations, the outputs from analyses and the associated scripts to reproduce our data.

The three main folders in the repository contains:

modeller -> the files and scripts to generate the models of the protomers
simulations -> templates files for gromacs to run preparation and md along with bash scripts for the preparation steps. The corresponding tratrajectories are deposited in OSF with skipped frames due to size limitation (the full trajectories can be provided upon request)
psn -> the files and scripts for the protein structure network analysis 
pca-> the files and scripts for the principal component analysis
